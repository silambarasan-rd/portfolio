                    <p className="about-description">
                      I have been working as
                      a Software engineer for more than 6 years.<br />
                      I was born and grew up in a city from
                      Tamilnadu, India named Cuddalore.
                      Our native place is the village Naduveerapattu
                      which is ~20 km far from Cuddalore.
                      I used to go there occasionally but
                      I&apos;ll be enjoying every moment I spend there.
                    </p>

                    <p className="about-description">
                    That&apos;s because the place is mostly filled with greens,
                    less populated, less polluted and of course
                    a <strong>peaceful environment</strong>.</p>

                    <p className="about-description">
                    In my college days, I used to do a lot of photo and
                    video editing in my spare time and I really loved it,
                    so I learned Adobe Photoshop and Adobe After Effects
                    by watching online tutorials. but after getting into
                    the Software development industry, I lost interest
                    in Photoshop/video editing as my focus totally changed
                    to upskilling myself for development. So nowadays I&apos;m
                    using Photoshop only to crop/resize an image or to make
                    any changes to my resume ðŸ˜‰
                    </p>

                    <p className="about-description">
                      In the weekends or in my free time,
                      I used to listen <strong>Music</strong>,
                      play PC games, watch Movies,
                      read <strong>Adventure</strong> Books,
                      pencil <strong>Sketching</strong>,
                      learn & play Guitar and learn & play Piano.
                    </p>

                    <p className="about-description">
                      Don&apos;t ask me why but I don&apos;t use Android

                      and I still can&apos;t find a reason to have a smartphone.
                      <br />
                      Of course, there are disadvantages I admit that
                      but believe me, there are a lot of advantages to it ðŸ˜‡
